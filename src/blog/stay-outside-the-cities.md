    <p>Staying outside of the cities long-term can be a great way to experience the local culture and save money on travel expenses. Here are some reasons why:
    </p><br>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Affordability</b>: Staying outside of the cities is often more affordable than staying in the heart of the city. Accommodations, food, and transportation costs can be significantly lower, allowing you to stretch your travel budget further.</li>
        <li><b>Authenticity</b>: Staying in smaller towns or rural areas can provide a more authentic experience of the local culture. You can meet locals, try traditional foods, and learn about the history and traditions of the area. </li>
        <li><b>Natural beauty</b>: Staying outside of the cities often means being surrounded by beautiful natural landscapes. You can go hiking, explore the countryside, and appreciate the stunning views.</li>
        <li><b>Peace and quiet</b>: Cities can be noisy and chaotic, and staying outside of them can provide a much-needed break from the hustle and bustle. It can be a great way to relax and recharge while still enjoying your travels.</li>
    </ol><br>
    <p>Staying outside of the cities long-term can be a great way to save money, experience the local culture, enjoy natural beauty, and find peace and quiet. So, consider taking a break from the cities and explore what the surrounding areas have to offer. I'll try and write a full blog post about this topic in more detail.
